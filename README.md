# Rust invaders

Rust invaders is a small "Space invaders" like game implemented in rust
targeting the web platform using webassembly. The purpose of this project was
to determine the feasibility of implementing simple retro 2d games in rust for
the web platform.

You can find a live demo [here]() (do not forget to use a browser supporting webassembly).

## Control

* Use space to shoot or gamepad button 1 (on xbox gamepad A button)
* Use A or arrow left to move left
* Use D or arrow right to move right
* You can also use gamepad controller axis 1 to navigate horizontally
